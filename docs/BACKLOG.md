# Backlog

The canonical list of deferred work. Each item carries just enough design that a
future session can build it without re-discovery. Dated when added.

## W-9 on file + attach-to-invoice checkbox + annual refresh reminder (2026-08-19, Dan)

New clients ask for a W-9. Wanted: upload one to the app; a checkbox on the
send-invoice panel attaches it to that email; rare but ready. Plus a yearly
nudge to upload a fresh one.
- **Storage:** private bucket path `{owner_id}/w9/…pdf` (receipts-bucket RLS
  pattern); settings gains `w9_path` + `w9_uploaded_at` (additive migration).
  A W-9 carries SSN/EIN: owner-only, never on any public link, attached ONLY
  on the explicit checkbox.
- **Send:** `SendInvoicePanel` checkbox (unchecked default) →
  `sendInvoice` adds a second attachment; `lib/invoiceEmail.ts`'s attachments
  array already supports it. Panel hides the checkbox when no W-9 is on file
  (with an upload link to Settings).
- **Settings:** upload/replace control showing "uploaded <date>".
- **Annual reminder:** the existing cron digest
  (`app/api/cron/reminders/route.ts` + `reminder_log` once-per-day dedupe
  pattern) gains a line when `year(w9_uploaded_at) < current year`: "Upload a
  fresh W-9 for <year>."

## MileIQ import: reimbursable miles (2026-08-19, Dan)

Dan already classifies every drive in MileIQ; the "Mileage Reimbursement"
category exists in his chart, and the CPA-export sketch reserves a MileIQ slot.
Wanted: import MileIQ data to track reimbursable miles instead of retyping them.
- MileIQ exports drives as CSV/XLSX (date, start/end location, miles, purpose,
  computed value at the IRS rate). Import path can mirror the YNAB backfill
  pattern: pure parser lib + dry-run-default script or an upload UI.
- Open design questions for the brainstorm: do imported drives attach to SHOWS
  (feeding a mileage invoice line at the IRS rate, like per-diem) or to the
  LEDGER (a Mileage Reimbursement expense row), or both via the auto-bridge?
  How does Dan mark which drives belong to which show — by date match against
  show dates, or manual assignment from an imported queue?
- Rate: use MileIQ's own computed value column rather than hardcoding the IRS
  rate (it changes yearly and MileIQ already applies the right one per drive).

## Money module — remaining phases

- **Invoice/expense auto-bridge** (phase 3 of the bookkeeping design): paid
  invoices → income transactions; show expenses → ledger expenses; both match
  the bank feed via the existing adopt-on-import machinery. Also auto-feeds
  the Taxes envelope from each show's set-aside. Design in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-18-bookkeeping-module-reference.md`.
- **CPA year-end export**: category totals + income + per-show profit +
  MileIQ/home-office slots + receipts, shaped by the CPA's answers to the
  homework questions (in the reference doc).
- **Income-by-payee report**: Dan's YNAB tracked income per client; payee
  carries that here — a Reports section grouping income by payee.
- **SimpleFIN auto-connect** (optional, privacy-first alternative to Plaid).
- **Mark-as-owner-pay quick control** on imported rows (Edit covers it today).
- Category editor: no "new group" control (add categories only within existing
  groups); percent-style targets/goals per envelope; envelope auto-funding
  rules.

## Small / cosmetic

- Register rebuild accepted trade-offs (2026-08-21 review): row-click-to-edit is
  pointer-only (no keyboard path to edit/delete); both layouts mount in the DOM
  at once (duplicate aria-labels, ~400 nodes at the cap); punch 6-across is
  borderline at exactly 640px. Revisit in a register a11y pass.

- Browser-chrome tint (theme-color meta + manifest) stays media-based and does
  not follow the manual Appearance setting (2026-08-21). Accepted: a JS
  meta-updater on toggle is the known fix if it ever grates.

- Mixed hourly+day-rate invoice hours sheet (2026-08-20 review): the page-wide
  DT column trigger isn't scoped to full-sheet shows (a day-rate show's DT can
  add an empty DT column to an hourly show's table), and the ALL SHOWS total
  row sums NET/ST from day-rate shows whose columns don't print. Cosmetic;
  single-show invoices unaffected.

- Recent-moves line field order differs from the original sketch (info
  complete; cosmetic).
- Delete remains available on transfer-kind ledger rows (legitimate but
  unguarded by any special copy).
- `ledger_reconciliations` is written but never surfaced anywhere (audit trail
  only).
